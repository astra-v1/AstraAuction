## Description 📖
AstraAuction is a player-to-player marketplace plugin for [Lumi](https://github.com/koshakminedev/lumi).
The plugin preserves full item NBT, stores data in a database, and provides a clean and convenient GUI with search, sorting, and lot management.

## Features 🌟
- **NBT preservation** — items are sold exactly as they were owned by the seller.
- **Asynchronous database** — all queries run in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Transaction fee** — configurable tax percentage.
- **Return storage (claims)** — unsold lots and payments for offline sellers are stored until expiration.
- **GUI market** — buying, confirmation dialogs, and page navigation.
- **Sorting and search** — sort by price and search by item name.
- **Manage your lots** — view and cancel active lots via GUI.
- **Flexible database support** — SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL.
- **Localization** — built-in support for `eng`, `rus`, `ukr`, `jpn`, with the ability to add custom languages.

## Building from Source 🔨
1. Install **[JDK 21+](https://www.google.com/search?q=jdk+21)**.
2. [Clone the repository](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+clone+git+repository) and open the project directory.
3. Run the build command: `./gradlew build`
4. The compiled JAR will be located in `build/libs`.

### Build Warning ⚠️
The repository contains two `build.gradle` files:
one main file (using fallback repositories via `jitpack.io`) and another with the `.old` suffix (with original Lumi repositories).

If Lumi repositories are temporarily unavailable (e.g. HTTP 500 errors) and the build fails, just use the current `build.gradle` as-is.
Alternatively, to use the original Lumi repositories, remove or move the current `build.gradle`, and rename `build.gradle.old` by removing the `.old` suffix.
